Real Estate Data Scraping and Analysis

This project involves scraping real estate property details from the CommonFloor website for major cities, using BeautifulSoup to gather essential property information. The scraped data was then compiled into an MS Excel file to serve as the foundation for further data cleaning and analytical processes.

Project Overview

	•	Web Scraping: Used BeautifulSoup to extract detailed property data, including pricing, location, and property specifications, for selected major cities from the CommonFloor website.
	•	Data Compilation: Uploaded the scraped data to MS Excel, creating a structured dataset for further analysis.
	•	Data Preparation: The Excel dataset serves as the basis for data cleaning, validation, and any additional calculations.

Features

	•	Scraping Script: Python script using BeautifulSoup to:
	•	Navigate CommonFloor’s property listings.
	•	Extract property details such as price, area, location, and property type.
	•	Data Compilation in Excel: Exported the data to MS Excel, enabling:
	•	Easy access for further cleaning and analysis.
	•	Data validation, handling missing values, and calculations directly within Excel.

Tools Used

	•	Python and BeautifulSoup for web scraping.
	•	MS Excel for data compilation, cleaning, and basic calculations.

Getting Started

To replicate or explore this project:

	1.	Scraping Setup:
	•	Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt.
	•	Run the scraping script (scrape_properties.py) to extract property details from CommonFloor.
	2.	Data Compilation:
	•	Load the output data file into MS Excel for further manipulation and analysis.
	3.	Data Cleaning:
	•	Follow the data cleaning steps outlined in data_cleaning_guide.md to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Project Structure

	•	scrape_properties.py: Python script for scraping property details from CommonFloor.
	•	requirements.txt: Required libraries for the project.
